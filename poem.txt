# Departure

#### BY EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY

It's little I care what path I take,<br>
And where it leads it's little I care,<br>
But out of this house, lest my heart break,<br>
I must go, and off somewhere! <br>

It's little I know what's in my heart, <br>
What's in my mind it's little I know, <br>
But there's that in me must up and start, <br>
And it's little I care where my feet go! <br>

I wish I could walk for a day and a night,<br> 
And find me at dawn in a desolate place, <br>
With never the rut of a road in sight, <br>
Or the roof of a house, or the eyes of a face. <br>

I wish I could walk till my blood should spout, <br>
And drop me, never to stir again, <br>
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out, <br>
And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain. <br>

But dump or dock, where the path I take <br>
Brings up, it's little enough I care, <br>
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make, <br>
Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere. <br>

*"Is something the matter, dear," she said,*<br>
*"That you sit at your work so silently?"*<br>
*"No, mother, no—'twas a knot in my thread.*<br>
*There goes the kettle—I'll make the tea."*<br>
